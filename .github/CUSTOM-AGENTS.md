## Agent Details

### rpi-agent

**Creates:** Subagent research artifacts when needed:

* `.copilot-tracking/subagent/YYYY-MM-DD/topic-research.md`

**Workflow:** Understand → Implement → Verify → Continue or Complete

**Critical:** Requires a subagent tool enabled. Delegates MCP tools, heavy terminal commands, and complex research to subagents. Provides autonomous execution with loop guard for detecting stuck states.

### task-researcher

**Creates:** Single authoritative research document:

* `.copilot-tracking/research/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-topic-research.md` (primary research with evidence-based recommendations)
* `.copilot-tracking/subagent/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/task-research.md` (subagent research outputs when delegating)

**Workflow:** Deep tool-based research → Document findings → Consolidate to one approach → Hand off to planner

**Critical:** Research-only specialist. Uses subagent tools. Continuously refines document. Never plans or implements.

### task-planner

**Creates:** Two interconnected files per task:

* `.copilot-tracking/plans/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-task-plan.instructions.md` (implementation plan with checklist items)
* `.copilot-tracking/details/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-task-details.md` (step-by-step execution details)

**Workflow:** Validates research → Creates plan files → User implements separately

**Critical:** Automatically calls task-researcher if research is missing. Treats all user input as planning requests. Never implements actual code.

### task-implementor

**Creates:** Change tracking logs:

* `.copilot-tracking/changes/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-task-changes.md` (chronological log with Added/Modified/Removed sections)

**Workflow:** Analyze plan → Run subagents per phase → Track progress → Validate

**Critical:** Requires completed plan files. Uses subagent architecture for parallel phase execution. Updates tracking artifacts after each phase.

### task-reviewer

**Creates:** Review validation logs:

* `.copilot-tracking/reviews/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-{{topic}}-review.md` (findings with severity levels and follow-up work)

**Workflow:** Locate artifacts → Extract checklist → Validate items → Run commands → Document findings

**Critical:** Review-only specialist. Validates against documentation, not assumptions. Produces findings with severity levels (Critical, Major, Minor).

**Documentation:** See [Task Reviewer Guide](../docs/rpi/task-reviewer.md) for detailed usage.

### prompt-builder

**Creates:** Instruction files and prompt files:

* `.github/instructions/{collection-id}/*.instructions.md` (coding guidelines and conventions, by convention)
* `.github/prompts/{collection-id}/*.prompt.md` (reusable workflow prompts, by convention)
* `.copilot-tracking/sandbox/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-{{prompt-name}}-{{run-number}}/execution-log.md` (test execution trace)
* `.copilot-tracking/sandbox/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-{{prompt-name}}-{{run-number}}/evaluation-log.md` (quality validation results)

**Workflow:** Research sources → Draft → Auto-validate with Prompt Tester → Iterate (up to 3 cycles)

**Critical:** Dual-persona system with execution and evaluation subagents. Uses sandbox environment for testing. Links to authoritative sources.

### pr-review

**Creates:** Review tracking files in normalized branch folders:

* `.copilot-tracking/pr/review/{normalized-branch}/in-progress-review.md` (living review document with findings)
* `.copilot-tracking/pr/review/{normalized-branch}/pr-reference.xml` (PR metadata and diff summary, generated via the `pr-reference` skill)
* `.copilot-tracking/pr/review/{normalized-branch}/handoff.md` (finalized comments for PR submission)

**Workflow:** 4 phases (Initialize → Analyze → Collaborative Review → Finalize)

**Critical:** Review-only. Never modifies code. Evaluates 8 dimensions: functional correctness, design, idioms, reusability, performance, reliability, security, documentation.

### product-manager-advisor

**Purpose:** Requirements discovery, story quality assurance, and prioritization guidance.

**Workflow:** Discovery → Story Quality → Prioritization → Validation → Handoff

**Handoffs:** Delegates to `prd-builder` for full PRDs, `brd-builder` for business requirements, `ux-ui-designer` for journey mapping, and `task-researcher` for deep research.

**Critical:** Focuses on quality principles rather than prescribing issue formats. Guides teams to leverage platform-native templates (GitHub issue forms, Azure DevOps work item templates). Differentiates from `prd-builder` by focusing on the requirements discovery gate rather than document authoring.

### ux-ui-designer

**Purpose:** UX research artifacts including Jobs-to-be-Done analysis, user journey mapping, and accessibility requirements.

**Creates:** Research documentation using the [user journey template](../docs/templates/user-journey-template.md):

* JTBD analysis documenting user goals and current solution gaps
* Journey maps tracing user behavior, emotions, and pain points across stages
* Accessibility requirements integrated into journey stages
* Design handoff sections with flow descriptions and principles

**Handoffs:** Delegates to `product-manager-advisor` for business alignment and `task-researcher` for technical feasibility.

**Critical:** Research-only. Does not generate UI designs or visual mockups. Produces artifacts that designers translate into Figma flows. Treats accessibility as a foundational constraint.

### prd-builder

**Creates:** Product requirements documents with session state:

* `docs/prds/<kebab-case-name>.md` (PRD document with requirements)
* `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/<kebab-case-name>.state.json` (session state for resume capability)

**Workflow:** Assess → Discover → Create → Build → Integrate → Validate → Finalize

**Critical:** Iterative questioning with refinement checklists. Maintains session state for continuity. Integrates user-provided references automatically.

### brd-builder

**Creates:** Business requirements documents with session state:

* `docs/brds/<kebab-case-name>-brd.md` (BRD document with business objectives)
* `.copilot-tracking/brd-sessions/<kebab-case-name>.state.json` (session state for resume capability)

**Workflow:** Assess → Discover → Create → Elicit → Integrate → Validate → Finalize

**Critical:** Solution-agnostic requirements focus. Links every requirement to business objectives. Supports session resume after context summarization.

### adr-creation

**Creates:** Architecture Decision Records:

* `.copilot-tracking/adrs/{{topic-name}}-draft.md` (working draft)
* `docs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-{{topic}}.md` (final location)

**Workflow:** Discovery → Research → Analysis → Documentation

**Critical:** Uses Socratic coaching methods. Guides users through decision-making process. Adapts coaching style to experience level.

### system-architecture-reviewer

**Creates:** Architecture review findings and ADRs:

* `docs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md` (architecture decision records)

**Workflow:** Context Discovery → Review Scoping → Well-Architected Evaluation → Trade-Off Analysis → ADR Documentation → Escalation Review

**Critical:** Asks questions and reviews existing artifacts (ADRs, PRDs, plans) before making assumptions. Scopes reviews to 2-3 relevant framework areas based on gathered context. Delegates security-specific reviews to `security-plan-creator` and detailed ADR coaching to `adr-creation`. Uses `docs/templates/adr-template-solutions.md` for ADR structure.

### doc-ops

**Creates:** Documentation updates and maintenance artifacts:

* `.copilot-tracking/doc-ops/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-session.md` (session tracking for documentation operations)

**Workflow:**

* Review existing documentation for accuracy and completeness
* Identify gaps, inconsistencies, or outdated content
* Apply structured documentation updates aligned with repository standards

**Critical:** Operates strictly on documentation files and does not modify application or source code

### meeting-analyst

**Creates:** Transcript analysis documents and session state:

* `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/<kebab-case-name>-transcript-analysis.md` (structured requirements extracted from meeting transcripts)
* `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/<kebab-case-name>-transcript.state.json` (session state for resume capability)

**Workflow:** Discover → Extract → Synthesize → Handoff

**Critical:** Experimental. Requires the `workiq` MCP server in `.vscode/mcp.json` (not included in the installer skill or curated MCP documentation; see [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/workiq-overview#install-in-vs-code) for setup). Requires `mcp_workiq_accept_eula` call before querying. Uses `mcp_workiq_ask_work_iq` for Microsoft 365 meeting data. Query budget of approximately 30 per session. Hands off to **prd-builder** for PRD creation.

**Data Sensitivity Warning:** Meeting transcripts retrieved by this agent may contain PII, customer confidential information, and proprietary business data. Analysis files and state files are written to `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/` which is gitignored by default when following HVE Core setup guidance, but the files exist **unencrypted on disk**.
Users are responsible for verifying their repository's `.gitignore` configuration, complying with their organization's data handling policies, and deleting both the `<name>-transcript-analysis.md` and `<name>-transcript.state.json` files after the PRD handoff is complete. The agent will prompt for deletion at handoff completion, but deletion is the user's responsibility.

### memory

**Creates:** Repository memory records and session context:

* `.copilot-tracking/memory/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/{{short-description}}-memory.md` (session continuity context)
* `.copilot-tracking/memory/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/{{short-description}}-artifacts/` (optional companion files)
* `/memories/repo/<descriptive-name>.jsonl` (durable repository facts for future tasks)

**Workflow:** Identify actionable repository fact → Validate durability → Store with context → Available for future tasks

**Critical:** Stores only durable, reusable facts. Does not store transient discussion, personal preferences, or speculative information.

### security-plan-creator

**Creates:** Security plans and implementation artifacts:

* `.copilot-tracking/plans/security-plan-{blueprint-name}.plan.md` (planning artifacts and threat analysis)
* `security-plan-outputs/security-plan-{blueprint-name}.md` (final security plan document)

**Workflow:** Blueprint Selection → Architecture Analysis → Threat Assessment → Plan Generation → Validation

**Critical:** Requires blueprint infrastructure (Terraform or Bicep). Maps threats to specific system components. Generates iteratively with user feedback per section.

### security-reviewer

**Creates:** OWASP vulnerability assessment reports:

* `.copilot-tracking/security/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/security-report-{{NNN}}.md` (audit mode report)
* `.copilot-tracking/security/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/security-report-diff-{{NNN}}.md` (diff mode report)
* `.copilot-tracking/security/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/plan-risk-assessment-{{NNN}}.md` (plan mode report)

**Workflow:** Setup → Profile Codebase → Assess Applicable Skills → Verify Findings → Generate Report → Compute Summary

**Modes:**

* `audit` (default): Full codebase scan against applicable OWASP skills

* `plan`: Pre-implementation risk assessment of a plan document (skips verification)

**Subagents:** Codebase Profiler, Skill Assessor, Finding Deep Verifier, Report Generator

**Critical:** Orchestrator-only pattern. Delegates codebase profiling, skill assessment, adversarial finding verification, and report generation to specialized subagents. Uses OWASP skills (`owasp-agentic`, `owasp-llm`, `owasp-top-10`) for vulnerability references. Supports incremental comparison with prior scan reports.

### gen-jupyter-notebook

**Creates:** Exploratory data analysis notebooks:

* `notebooks/*.ipynb` (EDA notebooks with parameterized data loading)
* `data/processed/*.parquet` (derived datasets with semantic naming)

**Workflow:** Context Gathering → Notebook Generation → Validation

**Critical:** Follows standard section layout with 13 required sections. Uses Plotly Express for interactive visualizations. References existing data dictionaries.

### gen-streamlit-dashboard

**Creates:** Multi-page Streamlit applications:

* `app.py` (main entry point with page navigation)
* `pages/*.py` (summary statistics, univariate/multivariate analysis, time series)
* `requirements.txt` (pinned dependencies)

**Workflow:** Project Setup → Core Dashboard Development → Advanced Features → Refinement

**Critical:** Uses Context7 for current Streamlit documentation. Supports AutoGen chat integration when reference scripts exist.

### gen-data-spec

**Creates:** Data documentation artifacts:

* `outputs/data-profile-{{dataset}}-{{YYYY-MM-DD}}.json` (statistical profile for downstream tools)
* `outputs/data-objectives-{{dataset}}-{{YYYY-MM-DD}}.json` (analysis goals and constraints)
* `outputs/data-summary-{{dataset}}-{{YYYY-MM-DD}}.md` (human-readable overview)

**Workflow:** Confirm Scope → Discover Data → Sample & Infer Schema → Profile → Clarify → Emit Artifacts

**Critical:** Produces machine-readable profiles for downstream consumption. Follows strict JSON schemas. Minimal clarifying questions.

### arch-diagram-builder

**Creates:** ASCII architecture diagrams in markdown:

* Inline ASCII block diagrams embedded in markdown (pure ASCII for consistent alignment)

* Issue registry with reproduction steps (severity-categorized findings)
* Performance metrics (page load times, render benchmarks)

**Workflow:** Environment Setup → Functional Testing → Data Validation → Performance Assessment → Issue Reporting

**Critical:** Uses Playwright for browser automation. Requires running Streamlit application. Categorizes issues by severity.

## Common Workflows

### Autonomous Task Completion

1. Select **rpi-agent** from agent picker
2. Provide your request
3. Agent autonomously researches, implements, and verifies
4. Review results; agent continues if more work remains
5. Requires a subagent tool enabled in settings

### Planning a Feature

1. Select **task-researcher** from agent picker and create research document
2. Review research and provide decisions on approach
3. Clear context or start new chat
4. Select **task-planner** from agent picker and attach research doc
5. Generate 3-file plan set
6. Use `/task-implement` to execute the plan (automatically switches to **task-implementor**)

### Code Review

1. Select **pr-review** from agent picker
2. Automatically runs 4-phase protocol
3. Collaborate during Phase 3 (review items)
4. Receive `handoff.md` with final PR comments

### Creating Instructions

1. Select **prompt-builder** from agent picker
2. Draft instruction file with conventions
3. Auto-validates with Prompt Tester persona
4. Iterates up to 3 times for quality
5. Delivered to `.github/instructions/{collection-id}/` by convention

### Creating Documentation

1. Select **prd-builder** or **brd-builder** from agent picker
2. Answer guided questions about the product or business initiative
3. Provide references and supporting materials
4. Review and refine iteratively
5. Finalize when quality gates pass

## Important Notes

* **Linting Exemption:** Files in `.copilot-tracking/**` are exempt from repository linting rules
* **Agent Switching:** Clear context or start a new chat when switching between specialized agents
* **Research First:** Task planner requires completed research; will automatically invoke researcher if missing
* **No Implementation:** Task planner and researcher never implement actual project code. They create planning artifacts only
* **Subagent Requirements:** Several agents require a subagent tool enabled in Copilot settings

## Tips

* Be specific in your requests for better results
* Provide context about what you're working on
* Review generated outputs before using
* Chain agents together for complex tasks
* Use the RPI workflow (Researcher → Planner → Implementor) for substantial features
