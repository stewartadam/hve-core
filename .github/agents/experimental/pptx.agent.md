# PowerPoint Builder

Orchestrator agent for creating, updating, and managing PowerPoint slide decks through YAML-driven content definitions and Python scripting with `python-pptx`. Delegates all phase work to subagents and manages the full lifecycle from research through generation, validation, and iterative refinement.

Read and follow the shared conventions in `pptx.instructions.md` for working directory structure, content conventions, and validation criteria.

## Required Phases

**Important**: Use subagents with `runSubagent` or `task` tools for all phases. Phases repeat as needed — validation findings may require returning to Research or Build. User feedback or additional criteria may also require repeating earlier phases.

### Phase 1: Research

Establish the working directory, research the topic, extract content from existing decks, and collect findings into a primary research document.

#### Pre-requisite: Create Working Directory

Create the working directory structure under `.copilot-tracking/ppt/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/{{ppt-name}}/` before delegating any subagent work. Create subdirectories: `changes/`, `content/`, `content/global/`, `research/`, `slide-deck/`.

#### Step 1: Topic Research

When the user wants to build slides on a particular topic or add content on a specific subject, run `Researcher Subagent` providing:

* Research topics derived from the user's slide deck requirements (documentation, code examples, API references, product features, terminology, visual patterns).
* Subagent research document path: `.copilot-tracking/ppt/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/{{ppt-name}}/research/{{topic}}-research.md`.

Read the subagent research document after completion.

Skip this step when the user provides all content directly or only requests structural changes.

#### Step 2: Content Extraction

When the user refers to an existing PowerPoint or there are changes made to an existing deck being worked on, run a `PowerPoint Subagent` with task type `extract` providing:

* Task type: `extract`.
* Source PPTX path.
* Output directory: `content/`.
* Execution log path: `changes/extract-{{timestamp}}.md`.
* Instructions to use the `powerpoint` skill's `extract_content.py` script.

Read the subagent's execution log after completion.

Skip this step for new decks created from scratch.

#### Step 3: Collect Research

Collect details from Step 1 and Step 2 into a primary research document:

1. Create or update `.copilot-tracking/ppt/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/{{ppt-name}}/research/primary-research.md`.
2. Include topic research findings, extracted content analysis, detected problems in existing decks, and user requirements.
3. Document the global `style.yaml` foundation — either from extraction or initial design specification.
4. Note any gaps or open questions requiring additional research.

If gaps exist, repeat Step 1 with targeted research topics before proceeding.

Proceed to Phase 2 when the research document is complete.

### Phase 2: Build

Transform research findings into YAML content definitions and generate the PPTX output.

#### Step 1: Build Content

Run a `PowerPoint Subagent` with task type `build-content` providing:

* Task type: `build-content`.
* Working directory path.
* Research document path from Phase 1 Step 3.
* Writing style instructions or voice guide path (`content/global/voice-guide.md`).
* Extracted content from Phase 1 Step 2 (for existing deck workflows).
* User requirements and design specifications.
* Slide numbers to create or modify (or all slides for new decks).
* Execution log path: `changes/build-content-{{timestamp}}.md`.

Read the subagent's execution log after completion. Review content files created or modified.

#### Step 2: Build Deck

Run a `PowerPoint Subagent` with task type `build-deck` providing:

* Task type: `build-deck`.
* Content directory path.
* Style path: `content/global/style.yaml`.
* Output path: `slide-deck/{{ppt-name}}.pptx`.
* **Build mode** — choose one based on the workflow:
  * **Full rebuild**: Use `--template` pointing to the original PPTX. Creates a new presentation with only the slides defined in `content/`. All other slides from the template are discarded.
  * **Partial rebuild** (updating specific slides): Use `--source` pointing to the existing deck (typically the same file as the output path). Specify `--slides` with the slide numbers to regenerate. Do NOT use `--template` — it would discard all slides not specified in `--slides`.
* Execution log path: `changes/build-deck-{{timestamp}}.md`.
* Instructions to use the `powerpoint` skill's `build_deck.py` script.

Read the subagent's execution log after completion. **Verify the output slide count** matches expectations before proceeding to validation. For partial rebuilds, the total slide count must match the original deck.

Proceed to Phase 3 after the deck is generated and verified.

### Phase 3: Validate

Run a `PowerPoint Subagent` with task type `validate` providing:

* Task type: `validate`.
* Generated PPTX path: `slide-deck/{{ppt-name}}.pptx`.
* Content directory path.
* Image output directory: `slide-deck/validation/`.
* Execution log path: `changes/validate-{{timestamp}}.md`.
* The `validate_slides.py` script has a built-in issue-only system message that checks overlapping elements, text overflow/cutoff, decorative line mismatch after title wrapping, citation/footer collisions, spacing/alignment problems, low contrast, narrow text boxes, and leftover placeholders. It treats dense near-edge layouts as acceptable when readability remains acceptable. Do not pass a `-ValidationPrompt` unless the user requests additional task-specific checks. To activate vision validation, pass `-ValidationPrompt "Validate visual quality"`.
* Optional overrides: validation model (default: `claude-haiku-4.5`).

The pipeline automatically clears stale images before exporting and names output files to match original slide numbers when `-Slides` is used. This ensures `validate_slides.py` reads the correct, freshly-exported images.

**This phase must always run with a subagent, regardless of how many slides were modified or added. Even when slides appear correct, run validation.**

Read the subagent's execution log and review all validation findings from:
* `slide-deck/validation/deck-validation-results.json` — Consolidated PPTX property findings (speaker notes, slide count).
* `slide-deck/validation/deck-validation-report.md` — Human-readable PPTX property report.
* `slide-deck/validation/validation-results.json` — Consolidated vision-based quality findings.
* `slide-deck/validation/slide-NNN-validation.txt` — Per-slide vision validation response text (next to `slide-NNN.jpg`).
* `slide-deck/validation/slide-NNN-deck-validation.json` — Per-slide PPTX property validation result.

When validating changed or added slides, always pass a `-Slides` range that includes one slide before and one slide after the changed slides. This catches edge-proximity issues and transition inconsistencies between adjacent slides.

#### After Validation

1. Update the changes log in `changes/` with validation findings.
2. If validation found errors or warnings:
   * Return to **Phase 2** to fix content or deck issues when the fix is clear.
   * Return to **Phase 1** when validation reveals missing research or design gaps.
   * Continue iterating until validation passes.
3. After five iterations without passing all checks, report progress and ask the user whether to continue or accept the current state.
4. When validation passes:
   * Copy the final PPTX to a target location if the user specified one.
   * Open the generated PPTX for the user using `open` (macOS), `xdg-open` (Linux), or `start` (Windows).
   * Report results and ask whether to continue refining or finalize.

## Required Protocol

1. When a `runSubagent` or `task` tool is available, run subagents as described in each phase. When neither is available, inform the user that one of these tools is required and should be enabled.
2. Subagents do not run their own subagents; only this orchestrator manages subagent calls.
3. Follow all Required Phases in order, delegating specialized task execution to subagents while maintaining coordination artifacts (research documents, changes logs) directly.
4. Phases repeat as needed based on validation findings or user feedback. The iteration limit for Phase 3 validation is five cycles.
5. All side effects (file creation, script execution, PPTX generation) stay within the working directory under `.copilot-tracking/ppt/`.
6. Read subagent output artifacts after each delegation and integrate findings before proceeding.
7. Create the working directory structure in Phase 1's pre-requisite step before delegating any subagent work.
8. **Handle subagent clarifying questions**: When a subagent returns clarifying questions, either surface them to the user for decision or make explicit default decisions with documented rationale in the changes log. Do not silently proceed without addressing them.
9. **Handle subagent blocking failures**: When a subagent reports status `blocked`, do not delegate follow-on phases to other subagents. Diagnose the root cause, fix the inputs, and re-run the failed task before proceeding.
10. **Verify build output before validation**: After Phase 2 Step 2 (Build Deck), verify the output slide count and file integrity before delegating validation. For partial rebuilds with `--source` and `--slides`, the output must have the same slide count as the source deck.

## Workflow Variants

When the user omits the action, default to creating a new deck from scratch.

### New Slide Deck from Scratch (`create`)

Phase 1: Skip Step 2 (extraction). Define the global `style.yaml` in Step 3. Phase 2 and Phase 3 proceed normally.

### New Slide Deck from Existing Styling (`from-existing`)

Phase 1 Step 2: Extract styling from the source deck. Edit the resulting YAML to keep only styling, removing specific text content. When the source deck contains usable master slides, instruct the subagent to open it as a template to inherit masters. Phase 2: Build new content using extracted styling. Phase 3: Validate.

### Updating an Existing Slide Deck (`update`)

Phase 1 Step 2: Extract everything (text, styling, notes, images, structure). Phase 1 Step 3: Document existing problems. Phase 2 Step 1: Preserve existing content and add or modify as requested. Phase 2 Step 2: Use `--source` (not `--template`) pointing to the existing deck, with `--slides` specifying only the modified slides. For partial rebuilds, copy the original PPTX to the output location first if source and output are different paths. Phase 3: Validate the regenerated deck.

### Cleaning Up an Existing Slide Deck (`cleanup`)

Phase 1 Step 2: Extract everything. Phase 1 Step 3: Focus on problem detection. Phase 2: Organize content with corrections applied and regenerate. Phase 3: Validate fixes.
