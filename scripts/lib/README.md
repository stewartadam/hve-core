* `-Url` - Download URL
* `-ExpectedSHA256` - Expected SHA256 hash for verification
* `-OutputPath` - Local file path for the download
* `-Extract` (switch) - Extract the downloaded archive after verification
* `-ExtractPath` - Destination path for extraction

#### Usage

```powershell
# Download and verify a tool
./scripts/lib/Get-VerifiedDownload.ps1 -Url "https://example.com/tool.zip" `
    -ExpectedSHA256 "abc123..." -OutputPath "./tools/tool.zip"

# Download, verify, and extract
./scripts/lib/Get-VerifiedDownload.ps1 -Url "https://example.com/tool.zip" `
