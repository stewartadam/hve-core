## Customization Spectrum

HVE Core supports a range of customization depths. Start with the lightest option that meets your needs, then move deeper when the situation demands it.

| Approach           | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VS Code Settings   | Individual preferences like font size, theme, and editor behavior. No files to create or share.                                                             |
| Instructions       | Configure Copilot behavior through `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.instructions.md` files. Lowest effort with highest return for shaping AI output. |
| Agents and Prompts | Specialized workflows: agents for multi-turn interactions, prompts for single-shot tasks. Both accept tool restrictions and delegation rules.               |
| Skills             | Domain knowledge in self-contained bundles with optional scripts. Use when instruction files alone cannot capture the depth of a domain.                    |
| Collections        | Bundle agents, prompts, instructions, and skills into distributable packages for team or organization adoption.                                             |
| Build System       | Validation scripts, schema checks, and plugin generation pipelines.                                                                                         |
| Fork and Extend    | Full control over every artifact. Fork the repository when your changes diverge significantly from upstream.                                                |

## Choose Your Approach

| Goal                                       | Approach        | Files Involved                                        | Difficulty |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Set coding standards for Copilot           | Instructions    | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.instructions.md` | Low        |
| Create a reusable workflow                 | Prompt          | `.github/prompts/{collection}/name.prompt.md`         | Low        |
| Build a specialized Copilot assistant      | Agent           | `.github/agents/{collection}/name.agent.md`           | Medium     |
| Package domain expertise                   | Skill           | `.github/skills/{collection}/{skill}/SKILL.md`        | Medium     |
| Share curated bundles across teams         | Collection      | `collections/*.collection.yml`                        | Medium     |
| Add custom validation or plugin generation | Build System    | `scripts/`, `package.json`                            | High       |
| Diverge from upstream entirely             | Fork and Extend | Full repository                                       | High       |

## Authoring with Prompt Builder

The [Prompt Builder](pathname://../../.github/agents/hve-core/prompt-builder.agent.md) agent streamlines creation, evaluation, and refinement of all artifact types. Three commands cover the full authoring workflow:

| Command            | Purpose                                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/prompt-build`    | Create new artifacts or improve existing ones                   |
| `/prompt-analyze`  | Evaluate quality and produce a structured assessment report     |
| `/prompt-refactor` | Consolidate, deduplicate, or restructure related artifact files |

Each artifact guide below includes an "Accelerating with Prompt Builder" section with type-specific examples and sample invocations.

## Role-Based Entry Points

Each HVE role benefits from different customization techniques. The table below maps the nine roles to the guides most relevant to their workflow.
