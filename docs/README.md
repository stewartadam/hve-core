HVE Core is a prompt engineering framework for GitHub Copilot designed for team-scale adoption. It provides specialized agents, reusable prompts, instruction sets, and a validation pipeline with JSON schema enforcement. The framework separates AI concerns into distinct artifact types with clear boundaries, preventing runaway behavior through constraint-based design.

## AI-Assisted Project Lifecycle

HVE Core supports a 9-stage project lifecycle from initial setup through ongoing operations, with AI-assisted tooling at each stage. The project lifecycle guides walk through each stage, covering available tools, role-specific guidance, and starter prompts.

* [Stage Overview](hve-guide/lifecycle/) - Full lifecycle map with Mermaid flowchart
* [Stage 6: Implementation](hve-guide/lifecycle/implementation.md) - Highest-density stage with 30 assets
* [Stage 2: Discovery](hve-guide/lifecycle/discovery.md) - Research, requirements, and BRD creation

**[AI-Assisted Project Lifecycle Overview →](hve-guide/lifecycle/)**

## Role Guides

Find your role-specific guide for AI-assisted engineering. Each guide maps the agents, prompts, and collections relevant to your responsibilities.

* [Engineer](hve-guide/roles/engineer.md) - RPI workflow, coding standards, implementation
* [TPM](hve-guide/roles/tpm.md) - Requirements, backlog management, sprint planning
* [New Contributor](hve-guide/roles/new-contributor.md) - Guided onboarding with progression milestones

**[Browse All Role Guides →](hve-guide/roles/)**

## Getting Started

The Getting Started guide walks through installation, configuration, and running your first Copilot workflow.

* [Installation Methods](getting-started/install.md) - Seven setup options from VSCode extension to submodule
* [MCP Configuration](getting-started/mcp-configuration.md) - Model Context Protocol server setup
* [First Workflow](getting-started/first-workflow.md) - End-to-end example with RPI agents

**[Getting Started Guide →](getting-started/)**

## Agent Systems

hve-core provides specialized agents organized into functional groups. Each group combines agents, prompts, and instruction files into cohesive workflows for specific engineering tasks.

* [RPI Orchestration](rpi/) separates complex tasks into research, planning, implementation, and review phases
* [GitHub Backlog Manager](agents/github-backlog/) automates issue discovery, triage, sprint planning, and execution across GitHub repositories
* Additional systems documented in the [Agent Catalog](agents/)

**[Browse the Agent Catalog →](agents/)**

## Design Thinking

AI-assisted Design Thinking uses the dt-coach agent to guide teams through nine methods across three spaces.

* [Design Thinking Guide](design-thinking/README.md): Overview and method catalog
* [Why Design Thinking?](design-thinking/why-design-thinking.md): When to use DT
* [Using the DT Coach](design-thinking/dt-coach.md): Agent usage guide
* [Browse all Design Thinking docs →](design-thinking/)

## RPI Methodology

Research, Plan, Implement (RPI) is a structured methodology for complex AI-assisted engineering tasks. It separates concerns into three specialized agents that work together.

* [Why RPI?](rpi/why-rpi.md) - Problem statement and design rationale
* [Task Researcher](rpi/task-researcher.md) - Discovery and context gathering
* [Task Planner](rpi/task-planner.md) - Structured task planning
* [Task Implementor](rpi/task-implementor.md) - Execution with tracking
* [Using Together](rpi/using-together.md) - Agent coordination patterns

**[RPI Documentation →](rpi/)**

## Prompt Engineering

HVE Core provides a structured approach to building AI artifacts with protocol patterns, input variables, and maturity lifecycle management.

* [Prompt Builder Agent](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/.github/agents/hve-core/prompt-builder.agent.md) - Interactive artifact creation with sandbox testing
* [AI Artifacts Overview](contributing/ai-artifacts-common.md) - Common patterns across artifact types
* [Activation Context](architecture/ai-artifacts.md#activation-context) - When artifacts activate within workflows

### Key Differentiators

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Constraint-based design | Agents know their boundaries, preventing runaway behavior |
| Subagent delegation     | First-class pattern for decomposing complex tasks         |
