# Azure DevOps Integration

Azure DevOps work item management, build monitoring, and pull request creation

## Overview

Manage Azure DevOps work items, monitor builds, create pull requests, and convert requirements documents into structured work item hierarchies — all from within VS Code.

This collection includes agents and prompts for:

- **Work Item Management** — Discover, create, update, and plan work items across ADO projects
- **Build Monitoring** — Query build status, review logs, and diagnose failures
- **Pull Request Creation** — Generate PRs with linked work items and reviewer identification
- **PRD-to-Work-Item Conversion** — Transform Product Requirements Documents into ADO feature/user-story/task hierarchies
- **Backlog Management** — Orchestrated triage, discovery, sprint planning, and work item creation workflows through a central ADO Backlog Manager agent

## Install

```bash
copilot plugin install ado@hve-core
```
