Security review, planning, incident response, risk assessment, and vulnerability analysis

> **⚠️ Experimental** — This collection is experimental. Contents and behavior may change or be removed without notice.

> [!CAUTION]
> The security agents and prompts in this collection are **assistive tools only**. They do not replace professional security tooling (SAST, DAST, SCA, penetration testing, compliance scanners) or qualified human review. All AI-generated security artifacts **must** be reviewed and validated by qualified security professionals before use. AI outputs may contain inaccuracies, miss critical threats, or produce recommendations that are incomplete or inappropriate for your environment.

## Overview

Security review, planning, incident response, risk assessment, and vulnerability analysis for cloud and hybrid environments.

This collection includes agents and prompts for:

- **Security Plan Creation** — Generate threat models and security architecture documents
- **Security Review** — Evaluate code and architecture for security vulnerabilities
- **Incident Response** — Build incident response runbooks and playbooks
- **Risk Assessment** — Evaluate security risks with structured assessment frameworks
- **Vulnerability Analysis** — Identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities
