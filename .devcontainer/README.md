A pre-configured development environment that includes all tools, extensions, and dependencies needed for HVE Core development. Ensures consistency across all development machines.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
* Git

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core.git
   cd hve-core
   ```

2. Open in VS Code:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. Reopen in container:
   * Press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   * Select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**
   * Wait for the container to build (first time takes 5-10 minutes)

## Included Tools

### Languages & Runtimes

* Node.js 20
* Python 3.11
* PowerShell 7.x

### CLI Tools

* Git
* GitHub CLI (`gh`)
* Azure CLI (`az`)
* actionlint (GitHub Actions workflow linter)

### Code Quality

* Markdown: markdownlint, markdown-table-formatter
* Spelling: Code Spell Checker (VS Code extension)
* Shell: shellcheck

### Security

* Gitleaks (secret scanning)

### PowerShell Modules

* PSScriptAnalyzer
* PowerShell-Yaml
* Pester 5.7.1

## Pre-installed VS Code Extensions

* Spell Checking: Street Side Software Spell Checker
* Markdown: markdownlint, Markdown All in One, Mermaid support
* GitHub: GitHub Pull Requests

## Common Commands

Run these commands inside the container:

```bash
# Lint Markdown files
markdownlint '**/*.md' --ignore node_modules

# Check spelling
cspell '**/*.md'

# Check shell scripts
shellcheck scripts/**/*.sh

# Security scan
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

Container won't build: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and you have sufficient disk space (5GB+).

1. Extensions not loading: Reload the window (`F1` → **Developer: Reload Window**).

2. HTTP/TLS errors during build: Machines with corporate firewalls performing TLS inspection should ensure they are using the default `desktop-linux` builder, which honors OS root certificate trust stores.
   You can change the active builder back to `desktop-linux` by running `docker buildx use desktop-linux`.
